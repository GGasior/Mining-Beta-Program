# Connecting your repository to GitHub

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to github.com and sign in
- Click the "+" button in the top right and select "New repository"
- Name it "LOTcryCRT"
- Make it public or private as desired
- Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (we've already created these)
- Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LOTcryCRT.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the connection
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LOTcryCRT.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LOTcryCRT.git (push)
```

## 4. That's it!
Your repository is now on GitHub. You can view it at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LOTcryCRT
